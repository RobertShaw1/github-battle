# github-battle

This was my very first react project.  

##### Update October 21, 2017
I have decided to go back and refactor this project using ES6 syntax.  Also, I was never able to get the battle page working the first time around but I think I know why.

##### Update October 28, 2017
I was able to get the project fully functional on October 24.  Today I as able to deploy using firebase.  Please visit https://rshaw-github-battle.web.app/

##### Update January 23, 2021
I finished refactoring this app to use react hooks. Deployed v1.2.0.
